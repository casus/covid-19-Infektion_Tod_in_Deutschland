We provide post-processing data of daily dead and infected COVID-19 cases for a county (Landkreise) and a state (Bundesland) level. The data are extracted from the following link [the data source](https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/f10774f1c63e40168479a1feb6c7ca74/data), and subsequently transferred to the Casus-HZDR database server (see Fig. \ref{fig1}). The age-based and gender-based data are then aggregated and prepared in csv file.
